As a college student, write a CSS file for a portfolio (based on the given Html code). I want the design to be clean, minimalist, and modern. The background should be a matte dark gray, and the text and accents should be white. For typography, use a sans-serif font. Headings should be bold and larger, For each section; name and profile, about me, and skills, create a large hero section that takes 60% of the page. the name should be big, bold typography( 3 to 5 rem). underneath, write a subtitle describing the role. for the profile image, make it circle and center it on the hero section. keep makeing the hero section, for other sections (About, Skills, Projects ) for the footer/Contact. place it on the center of the page with padding from bottom page margin. For the Skills section use buttons to name each skill or technologies and tools. buttons will move when hover.
