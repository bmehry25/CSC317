  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello! I am Bahara Mehry. I am a Computer Science Major in San Francisco State. I am learning new skills and building projects that combine coding with real-time problem-solving.  </p>
  <p>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are something I am passionate about. I believe that we are getting to be a part of great improvements in technology. While I am excited about their potential, I also recognize the risks. 
     I believe in responsible use and well-regulated guidance around use and developing these technologies. </p>
