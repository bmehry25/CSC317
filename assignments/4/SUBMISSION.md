## Overview
This project has 2 parts:

First part  is a fully functional version of iOS-style calculator built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  

#Features:

Includes a complete memory function (MC / MR / M+ / M−).
Includes a clear instructions on how to use the memory functions

### UI 
Grid keypad, with 4 columns 
Uses “clamp()” for automatically sizing the screen.
Display the input and result in a  larger font and display a  smaller expression “tape” of the number that has been inputted.

### Accessibility
Enter on the keyboard  for  equals  
Backspace on keyboard for delete last, take a step back. 
Can press the button or use keyboard for input. 


Second part is my personal portfolio and a link to calculator project in the projects section. For this part instead of using the assignment 3 where I worked on html file of a teammate, I used my assignment 2 and then wrote the css code for it and added my project there. 


## Individual Reflections
I did a big chunk of this assignment using AI but then I typed it myself using the AI generated code as a reference and tried to understand what each line of code does. I really enjoy doing the css part. I love the design part and i enjoy trying different things. As of now I find the java script part more confusing but i am sure that by practice i can learn and improve my skills on this part too.
